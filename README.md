## Basic commands

### Comment

We use comments to make the code more readable. There are two ways to put a comment in QBASIC.

They are:
- REM
- Single quote (')

Example:

```
REM "---------------------------------------"
REM "Prints alphabets from a to z and z to a"
REM "23/01/2078"
REM "Project by  Navadita :)"
REM "---------------------------------------"
```

### Print

We use Print to display strings and numbers in the console (output). 

Example:

```
Print "Hi there "; name$;
Print ""
```

### Input

Example:

```
Input "Do you study in grade"; class; "?"
```

### Loop
